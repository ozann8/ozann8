### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started: -->

- 🎓 I graduated from Suleyman Demirel University in 2022.
- 🤖 I completed my bachelor's degree in computer engineering.
- 🔭 I am interested in data science. I enjoy coding and trying to understand the math behind it.
- 🎯 My goal by the middle of the year is to gain proficiency in Spark and Hadoop software.
- ⚽ I enjoy following statistics in sports that interest me. Eurovision and football capture my interest most of the time.
- 🙌 Exploring a concept I want to learn about can take me to different worlds. The boundlessness of this field fascinates me.
